            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom the time I was a
            child I could always be described as a 'tinkerer'. My parents, at
            times exasperated with my consistent dismantling of household items,
            did as much as they could to feed my curiosity, buying me books on a
            myriad of scientific subjects, lots of models and LEGOs, or signing
            me up for workshops for children's crafts. I really owe them for
            fanning my flames of creativity, rather than rebuking me when they
            caught me taking apart their new fill-in-the-blank to "see how it
            works".

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs I grew into adolescence, I found
            summer jobs building decks or fences and picked up some real world
            skill, as well as a growing passion for using my hands to create. In
            school I took on extra curricular activities in the theater crew
            where we built extravagant sets for our school's plays. In my junior
            yeas of high school I started attending a vocational highschool part
            time in the electronics department, where I learned circuit design,
            electric principals and basic robotics.

          <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter graduating high
            school I found myself volunteering with Americorps working for
            several years with non-profit organizations like Habitat for
            Humanity, and Project Homecoming in New Orleans where I continued to
            develop skills in the construction trades, as well as some
            electrical and plumbing. I used the education awards alloted though
            the Americorps program to become certified in welding and returned
            to work rebuilding homes with Project Homecoming in New Orleans.
            While I was making a difference for people, I had always dreamt of
            making furniture for a living, but while I had the skills and access
            to tools it would take a rather drastic life event to give me the
            push I needed to take the leap.

          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI had been dreaming of
          making a living building furniture, but I had so many excuses and
          artificial limitations I set for myself, and it may have gone on like
          that forever, but fortunately in the winter of 2014 I tore my
          achilles. It was in the long recovery time from my injury that I
          finally got motivated to make serious change. I decided to rid my life
          of distractions and spend at least 4 - 8 hours a day building things.
          Below are a collection of some of my first pieces during this period.
