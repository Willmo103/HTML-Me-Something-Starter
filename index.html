         <p>From the time I was a child I could always be described as a 'tinkerer'. My parents, at times exasperated with my consistent dismantling of household items, did as much as they could to feed my curiosity, buying me books on a myriad of scientific subjects, lots of models and LEGOs, or signing me up for workshops for children's crafts. I really owe them for fanning my flames of creativity, rather than rebuking me when they caught me taking apart their new fill-in-the-blank to "see how it works".</p>

         <p>As I grew into adolescence, I found summer jobs building decks or fences and picked up some real world skill, as well as a growing passion for using my hands to create. In school I took on extra curricular activities in the theater crew where we built extravagant sets for our school's plays. In my junior yeas of high school I started attending a vocational highschool part time in the electronics department, where I learned circuit design, electric principals and basic robotics.</p>

            <p>After graduating high school I found myself volunteering with Americorps working for several years with non-profit organizations like Habitat for Humanity, and Project Homecoming in New Orleans where I continued to develop skills in the construction trades, as well as some electrical and plumbing. I used the education awards alloted though the Americorps program to become certified in welding and returned to work rebuilding homes with Project Homecoming in New Orleans. While I was making a difference for people, I had always dreamt of making furniture for a living, but while I had the skills and access to tools it would take a rather drastic life event to give me the push I needed to take the leap. </p>
